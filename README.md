# Anti-Akinator Game  

This is an **"Anti-Akinator"** guessing game where the genie (AI) secretly thinks of a **cricketer, a Mollywood actor, or a Hollywood actor**. The player's goal is to figure out who it is by asking **yes-or-no** questions and making a final guess.  

## How It Works  

1. **Start the Game**  
   - The AI selects a random cricketer, Mollywood actor, or Hollywood actor based on the chosen difficulty level.  

2. **Ask Questions**  
   - Players can ask only **yes-or-no** questions to narrow down the possibilities.  
   - The genie responds with:  
     - ✅ **"Yes"**  
     - ❌ **"No"**  
     - 🔴 **"Not Related"** (if the question is off-topic)  
     - ⚠️ **"Ask only yes or no questions"** (if the format is incorrect)  

3. **Make a Guess**  
   - Once the player has enough clues, they can submit their final guess.  
   - If the guess is **correct**, they win! 🎉  
   - If the guess is **incorrect**, they lose. ❌ The correct answer is then revealed.  

4. **Restart the Game**  
   - Players can refresh to start a new round with a different secret name.
